# Implementation of Machine Learning classifiers to some Data

Initially created as a practice of University Degree 

Actually only kNN classifier is implemented

Some improves could be:

	-Implement other classifiers

	-Apply normalitation to data (right now are pre-normalized)

	-More efficiency in calculations

Actual version 1.3
